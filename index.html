      <div class="test-text"><em>When I turned 18, I aged out of the foster care system with 
        no support. Then I found Forward Foster. They helped me find a 
        place to live, enroll in college, and access counseling and 
        mentoring services. They also connected me with other people who had similar experiences 
        and understood what I was going through. Thanks to Forward Foster, I was able to 
        make lasting connections, build my confidence and skills, and have hope for the future.</em>
