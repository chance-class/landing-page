      <div class="test-text"><em>I entered foster care when I was 12 years old, after my mom passed away. 
        I felt lost, alone and hopeless. When I turned 18, I aged out of the system with 
        no support, no plan and no future. Thatâ€™s when I found Forward Foster. They helped me find a 
        place to live, enroll in college, get a part-time job and access counseling and 
        mentoring services. They also connected me with other young adults who had similar experiences 
        and understood what I was going through. Thanks to Forward Foster, I was able to heal from my past 
        trauma, build my confidence and skills, and have hope for the future.</em>
