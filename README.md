# landing-page
My first landing page from scratch

Made several commits over 2 days but forgot to use git push. Aah!  Won't make that mistake again.

For this project, I used Flexbox to style a landing page. Many divs, many classes. I created a fake nonprofit and used Midjourney to create images.

I struggled with margins and padding to get everything to look like the image this project was based on. I ended up using vw to solve that issue but I think there could have been another way. Still learning.
